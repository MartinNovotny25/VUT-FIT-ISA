# VUT-FIT-ISA

Warning! This program has been tested by me and worked with email servers such as seznam.cz, centrum.sk, safe-mail.net etc. However, I have received 0/20 points for some reason. It is possible (my guess) that testing emails work with different formating of "Message-id" info, which I did not account for. If the message id info in the email header does not match the regex used, the program will end with an error. However, the program should be functional otherwise.

Good luck a nech sa na Vás usmieva Boh Cisár Ľudstva.
